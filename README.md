# gingermill
The goal of this project is to find what is longest path of all shortest path between any two wikipedia articles.

So for example between `Gingerbread` and `wind mill` is only one article separation in shortest path.

Idea for this project came from polsih saying "Co ma piernik do wiatraka?" what in direct transaltion means "What has Gingerbread for the windmill" which means "how could that make any sense" 

## How to run
You need to have install docker on your machine then you can run `docker compose up` to setup database. Then you can run `GingermillApplication.kt`
